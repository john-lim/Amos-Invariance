Amos-Multigroup
============================

This AMOS plugin simplifies the process in a multigroup analysis to check if there is a significant difference between groups in a model.

Installation
------------
Download `Amos-Multigroup.dll` file from [this location](https://github.com/john-lim/Amos-Invariance/blob/master/Amos-MasterValidity/obj/Debug/).
When the download completes, copy the dll into AMOS' `Plugins\` directory, which is normally located in 
`C:\Users\{accountName}\AppData\Local\AMOSDevelopment\AMOS\{AMOSVersion}\Plugins`. The `AppData` folder is hidden by default, but you can access it by either typing in the path directly or showing hidden files.
Restart AMOS, and the plugin should then show under the 'Plugins' menu in AMOS.

Usage
-----
In AMOS, build your model with desired number of latent variables. Run the plugin under the plugin menu and the html file pops up in your default browser.
